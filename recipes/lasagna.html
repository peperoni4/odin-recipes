    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally. </p>

        <li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>

        <li>

        <li>
            <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 7</h4>
            <p>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. </p>

        <li>
            <h4>Step 8</h4>
            <p>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese. </p>
